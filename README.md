## Weather App
This Weather App is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API to provide real-time weather updates for any city. Simply enter the city name, and the app fetches current weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon for visual reference.

Key Features:
Real-Time Weather Updates: Get up-to-date weather information for any city.
Error Handling: Displays a friendly error message for invalid or misspelled city names.
User-Friendly Interface: Clean and responsive design, offering a seamless user experience.
The project highlights the use of external APIs, asynchronous JavaScript with fetch(), and dynamic content updates, making it an excellent learning resource for working with APIs in web development.
